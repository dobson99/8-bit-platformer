#  Eight Bit Platformer

## Background

I started to write this platform game as a bit of fun while learning python
and to start to teach my kids programming. It's a hark back to the golden
8 bit days and currently is complete with the occasionaly, highly realistic
FALLING THROUGH SOLID PLATFORMS GLITCHES (which I have to fix :)

Obviously this is a work in progress and so it's a bit rough around the edges but the
basic game loop is in place with basic tests for moving between rooms etc. The whole thing could
do with a refactor as well.

I want to thank Katy's Code: https://katyscode.wordpress.com/ - I was able to use some
of her C++ algorithm which I ported to Python - this was a) great fun and b) very educational.

# Goal
Move between rooms using O and P and spacebar. Collect keys!
LOTS more to do on this but the basic physics and structure is in place.

## Setup
Windows (I used window 7, windows 10)
Python 3.x (I used 3.3)
Eclipse, Pycharm (not necessary but helpful)
Pygame 2D game library: I'm using pygame 1.9.2a0 - http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

## Tests
There are a number of tests - for now these should be run from the main directory 8-bit-platformer NOT the tests directory.
I need to do a bit of refactoring to move them into the tests directory.

The tests create dummy rooms and emulate the user pressing keys and moving between rooms.

* Further instructions forthcoming when I get round to it
